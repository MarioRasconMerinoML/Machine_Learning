# Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI and more

Tutorials and Notebooks around the usage of Scikit-Learn, Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch to tackle ML / IA / RL projects

As references to my self-learning I do use the following books:

Refs. 
- "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and, Keras and Tensorflow". A. Ger√≥n
- "Deep Learning with Python 2nd Ed". F. Chollet
- "Machine Learning with Pytorch and Scikit-Learn". S. Raschka, Y. (Hayden) liu, V. Mirjaili
- "Grokking Deep Learning". A. Trask
- "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action". A. Zai, B. Brown.
- "Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras" - Third Edition. A. Gulli, A. Kapoor,S.Pal

Also the online book "Dive into Deep Learning", provides a great source of knowledge

Online trainings like the "Deep Learning Specialization" or the "Machine Learning Specialization" in Coursera are great if you want to boost your knowledge.

Recently I discovered the course from Yann LeCun and Alfredo Canziani at NYY, the links are:

For Graph Neural Networks the Stanford Training from Jure Lescovec is great:
