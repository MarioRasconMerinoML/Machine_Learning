This folder will include implementations of RL algorithms in Keras / Tensorflow and Pytorch. 
It is intended to be as a self-study guide to introduce you in the coding of RL algorithms from classical ones to those implementing
Neural Networks.

One folder it is dedicated to the implementation of the Unity ML-Agents within the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. Done in Pytorch.
