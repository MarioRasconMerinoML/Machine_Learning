This folder will include implementations of RL algorithms in Keras / Tensorflow and Pytorch. 
It is intended to be as a self-study guide to introduce you in the coding of RL algorithms from classical ones to those implementing
Neural Networks.

One folder it is dedicated to the implementation of the Unity ML-Agents within the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree. Done in Pytorch.
In tne environment an agent is trained to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world. 

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

    0 - move forward.
    1 - move backward.
    2 - turn left.
    3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
